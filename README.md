# AutoParts Inc. AI Agent Implementation Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to implement AI Agents at AutoParts Inc., a mid-sized automotive parts manufacturer, to address quality defects, machine downtime, rising labour costs, and increasing customer demands for customization and delivery speed. The solution involves deploying multiple AI agent types to automate inspection, predictive maintenance, and order customization processes, improving operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## Key Features
- Real-time defect detection and quality control using computer vision agents.
- Predictive maintenance agents are analysing IoT sensor data to minimise machine downtime.
- Order processing and customisation agents optimising manufacturing schedules.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies as specified in `requirements.txt`.
3. Configure AI agent APIs and connect IoT sensor data.
4. Deploy agents to respective production facility endpoints.

## Usage
- Visual inspection alerts and reports are generated automatically.
- Maintenance schedules updated proactively based on AI predictions.
- Customer orders and customisation are managed seamlessly by AI agents.

## Simulation
The AI workflows are simulated using  [make.com](https://www.make.com/) to orchestrate defect detection alerts, maintenance triggers, and order fulfillment automation.

## Contribution Guidelines
Contributions are welcome to improve agent algorithms, expand integrations, and enhance system usability. Please follow standard code style and commit message conventions.
